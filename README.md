**Overview**
"Pygame Zero Character Animations" is a Python project utilizing Pygame Zero to demonstrate character animations and environment interactions. This project features a character navigating a 2D environment, where they can move left, right, and jump, showcasing basic physics like gravity and momentum.

**Features**
- **Character Animation**: Cycle through a series of character images to simulate walking and jumping.
- **Dynamic Background**: Implements a sky gradient and moving clouds to enhance visual appeal.
- **Physics Simulation**: Gravity affects the character's jumping and falling, providing a realistic motion.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use keyboard inputs to control the character's movement across the screen.

**How to Run**
To run this project, you must have Python and the Pygame Zero library installed.

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/shakib2412/PygameZeroCharacterAnimations.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the game script:
   pgzrun walking.py
**Gameplay**
- **Left Arrow Key**: Move the character left.
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move the character right.
- **Space Bar**: Make the character jump.
- **Esc Key**: Exit the game.

**Code Structure**
- **Character Handling**: Manages the loading, updating, and rendering of character animations.
- **Environment Effects**: Draws a gradient sky and moving clouds to create a dynamic background.
- **Physics Mechanics**: Applies gravity to character motion and manages jumping dynamics.
- **Game Loop**: Integrates drawing, updating, and event handling functions in a game loop using Pygame Zero.
